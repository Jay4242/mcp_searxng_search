# MCP SearxNG Search

This project provides an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that allows you to perform web searches using a [SearxNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) instance. It exposes a tool that can be called by other MCP-compatible applications, such as Goose.

## Getting Started

1.  Set the `SEARXNG_BASE_URL` environment variable to the base URL of your SearxNG instance.
2.  Install the package: `pip install .`

## Usage with Goose

1.  **Install the extension:** After installing the package, you can add this MCP server as an extension in Goose.
2.  **Add the extension in Goose:** Go to Settings > Extensions > Add.
3.  **Set the extension type:** Set the Type to StandardIO.
4.  **Provide the extension details:** Provide an ID, name, and description for your extension.
5.  **Set the command:** In the Command field, provide the absolute path to your executable using `uv run`. For example:

    ```bash
    uv run /full/path/to/mcp-searxng-search/.venv/bin/mcp-searxng-search
    ```

    Make sure to replace `/full/path/to/mcp-searxng-search` with the actual path to your project directory.

6.  **Using the extension:** Once integrated, you can start using your extension in Goose. Open the Goose chat interface and call your tool as needed. You can verify that Goose has picked up the tools from your custom extension by asking it "what tools do you have?"

The tool ID is `searxng_search`.
